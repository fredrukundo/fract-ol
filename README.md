# fract-ol
This project is about creating a small fractal exploration program. First, you have to know what a fractal is.

Your project must comply with the following rules:
• You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines,
or installing it using its sources.
• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.
• Global variables are forbidden.
